  <h2>Persona Profile: Student</h2>
  <p>
    This person is preferably and student at Fairfield University. Any student with an idea that they feel could be made into a great product with the assistance of an individual with money that they are willing to invest. This person should be a daily user of a mobile device and some form of a laptop. Being constantly connected to the mobile world is essential because with this they will be able to learn of the new opportunities that Stag Up has to offer. These members can be informed of the website through various notifications sent to them through the university; example, mail, posters, school email notification.
  </p>
  <h2>Persona Profile: Investors</h2>
  <h2>Persona Profile: Mentors</h2>
  <p>
   Mentors would want to attend the Fairfield Stag Up business showcase in order to see the final presentations of their mentees. They want to see what the mentees they invested their time and money into are able to finally come up with. They also want to give their mentees last minute advice and support to help them get through this big day. Mentors are also interested in seeing the the final presentations of other students. Mentors are also interested in meeting and networking with professors, investors, and other mentors. They can use this showcase as a means of bettering one’s self and learning from others. If their mentees succeed, it looks makes them look better as well.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mentors choose to go to the event  by choosing to be a mentor. One of the requirements of being a mentor is attending the showcase. In order to fulfill their mentor duties efficiently, they should be there. If they do not attend the StagUp showcase without a legitimate reason, it will look unprofessional and they might not be asked to mentor a group in the next year's showcase. As most mentors are professors from Fairfield University, they should be fairly familiar with the campus and be able to get there quickly and on time. Non-faculty mentors should have met with the students competing enough times to know Fairfield's campus relatively well. For the most part mentors will arrive using self-provided transportation.
  </p>
  <h2>Persona Profile: Media</h2>
  <p>
   The media would want to attend this conference in order to cover the event. Most of the media at the event will be local to the Fairfield area, however some of the media can also be Fairfield students reporting for The Mirror or similar outlets. Local media would be at this event to get the scoop on the best new businesses in the Fairfield area and of course to see which ones get funded and win the competition. Local Reporters and TV stations may want to interview the students, mentors,  and investors at the competition. We should invite as much media coverage as possible in order to get the name out about the competition and help it become even bigger. Positive media coverage of this event not only helps the competition, but makes the Dolan School of Business and Fairfield University itself look better.
  </p>
  <p>
   Members of the media will choose to go to the event if we have a large social media presence and help get the word out. We can help achieve this by both being active on Twitter and LinkedIN and by reaching out to media outlets. The more buzz and promotion the event gets, the more media will want to cover it. We can also ask student run media organizations such as the mirror, StagsTV and WVOF to advertise for and cover this event to get the word out to members of the student body and the surrounding Fairfield area . The media is one of the most important persona’s to aim for because of this. In order to make our site more accessible to the media, we should make information straightforward and easy to find.

  </p><h2>Persona Profile: Alumni</h2>
  <p>
   The Fairfield Alumni have a very broad and diverse range of traits given that Fairfield Alumni range from 22 years old to 96 years old featuring both men and women and different races. However it could be expected that the majority of the alumni that are putting large sums of money down to back students would be of an older age probably at least in their thirties. This is not to exclude the alumni in their twenties, however it is expected that there would be less of them there for the purpose of backing student groups financially. However there might also be alumni that show up to support family members of student who are involved in the StagUp program. This could be an older sibling or cousin who had graduated from Fairfield, or their parents or grandparents. All family is included, and this is considered an event worth attending due to vast amount of work each student puts into their project.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fairfield Alumni will be present at the Fairfield StagUp Program on April 7th for many reasons. One reason is because the school will invite alumni to impress them with what Fairfield is producing in hopes to attract donations from the alumni to give to Fairfield University. Some alumni would be attracted to the StagUp Program because they want to support fairfield and they see the StagUp program as a means of a support. They can support the event by being a backer to one of the student groups that are presenting their business model or pledging money to the winner.  Another reason is for business, having graduated from Fairfield the alumni knows what it takes to be a Fairfield students and feels the ideas and presentations that the Fairfield student are making will have more potential than one's from other schools or conventions. There is also more relatability with the fairfield students and their mentors which provides trust between the alumni backer and the students giving greater sense of confidence and security in on both sides.

  </p><h2>Persona Profile: Teachers</h2>
  <p>
   The teachers are also diverse in gender age and race, so there is a wide variety in differences between each teacher because of this. Teachers have an interest in attending the Stag Up program for many reasons, one of them being their connections to the students that are presenting in the StagUp program. Fairfield University teachers are also invested in to the school itself, especially the business school in particular. This means that the teachers are interested in advancement of the business school and want to attend it’s events. Teachers also might give incentives to students such as a bonus point on a test or quiz if they attend. To verify their students attendance the teachers must be at the StagUp events ensure that their students come to the program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of the teachers that will attend the event will have taught one or more of the students presenting in the program. The teachers have connections to these students and want to see them do well in their presentations and will attend the StagUp program to support the students and see the outcome. Some teachers have more than merely a “taught a few of the students presenting in a class” relationship, some of the teachers could have been asked by the students for help or advice on their business plan proposal. Many of the teachers have worked with the students the creation of the business plan meaning that while it is the students business plan proposal, the teachers had at least partially somewhat to do with the creation of the students business plan proposal given them a vested interest in the presentation and the outcome of the StagUp program. Many of the teachers could have even served as the mentor for the student group, another persona, that is defined separately, but would also mean that the teachers would be at the StagUp event.
